e = set() # It will generate empty set. Dont use s = {} as it will create an empty dictionary. As both starts with {} so there is difference between them(int ques: generate empty set)
s = {1, 5, 32, 54,5, 5, 5} #exp of set
# It will give output as { 32, 1, 5, 54} in set each values comes only once. So if we want to create something in which we want to
# use something only once, we can use set.

print(s)
