name = "Harry is a good  boy and  "

print(name.replace("  ", " ")) # it will print Harry is a good boy and means it is new string. so it updates original string by
# replace function and create new string but old string will remain same.
print(name) # Strings are immutable which means that you cannot change them by running functions on them. so it will
 # print original string ie Harry is a good  boy and 
# If you update list then original list will be change whereas original string will remain same.
# String usually starts with small letter whereas classes usually starts with capital letter.
